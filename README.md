# TheSeTTOntology-Repository
This repository contains all the turtle (.ttl) files that compose the SeTT ontology.
SeTT is a multi-layer ontology specifically designed to describe the semantic trajectories of Territorial Units (TUs). It models three types of trajectories: raw, structured, and semantic. Together, these trajectories create a comprehensive framework for capturing, organizing, and analyzing the evolution of TUs across various thematic domains, thereby improving users' ability to interpret and understand complex data.
